Purpose of site

The purpose of this site is to present information for a band. It is intended for a fan of the band who at least has a certain amount of knowledge about the history, but serves to inform new visitors as well. A brief biography section is included, as well as a picture gallery and sound files. The site has tried to balance being concise, as well as covering everything in a broad-sense; it is not a serious fan site, but it is presented as the 'official site'. A contact page with booking request information supports this.

UX (User Experience)

The site has a topnavbar, horizontally displayed. The user has to simply click on each relevant link. The layout is fairly interactive; the navlinks become highlighted when the user hovers over them with the cursor. Each page has the same background image, in order to create a cohesive layout. Social Media links are located at the bottom if the User would like to find out more.

Deployment

Initial writing of the code began in Gitpod IDE. Afterwards the site was deployed from the Gitpod IDE using the basic Gitpod commands; Git add; Git commit -m; and then Git push. One of the corrections made this time was the inclusion of a 'Docs' folder and 'CSS' folder, which due to problems in the earlier submission, were not included in the project.

Testing

After Deployment, the site was viewed on Github to make sure it looked OK visually, and any issues had been rectified. A point of concern was the image gallery; the first incarnation of the site displayed a below-par image gallery. Some corrections were made in the CSS; namely removing surplus code that performed the same task twice, such as 'display:block' After this was rectified, the image gallery become visually more pleasing.

The site was edited a few times; the colour was changed on the H1 and H2 elements, to green, to be more cohesive with the rest of the site. A picture from the image gallery was also deleted, to free up some space. This edited version was then pushed from Gitpod to Github.

Version Control

3 branches exist in total; the branch used in the deployment is called 'gitpod setup'; because I wasn't sure if this would be the version used in submission-at the time I was trying to get a handle on the Gitpod/Github process.
