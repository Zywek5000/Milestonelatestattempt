A place for my first milestone project

As a fan of the band, who wants to find out more, I can easily navigate the site and access a home page, bandbiography, picture gallery, tourdates, frequently asked questions, and sound
files of the band. I can also find contact information. The background image on the site is uniform, and offers a cohesive aesthetic appearance. 

Multiple versions of the site were deployed to test how it looked-in particular there was a problem with the image gallery-the gallery seemed to work in the IDE stages, but deployment
on the browser version, the format was untidy. Therefore the CSS code had to be corrected in order for the gallery to be properly visible. 

This time, the deployment was performed slighly better than before; the assets folder (with css folder inside) has now been included-and the files comprising the site are contained within, instead of how thet were
presented last time, with no containing folder.
